# FrozenLake
Frozen Lake Dynamic Programming file for the Advanced Machine Learning course of Udacity's Machine Learning nano-degree.

## Target :
Write my own implementations of many classical dynamic programming algorithms.

## Algorithm Class :
Frozen Lake

## Problem Type :
TBD

# Project Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/davidsprice/FrozenLake
cd FrozenLake
~~~~

2. Create and activate a new environment.

~~~~
conda create -n FrozenLake python=3.6 matplotlib numpy pandas keras-gpu
source activate FrozenLake
~~~~

3. Create an [IPython kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the Frozen Lake environment.

~~~~
python -m ipykernel install --user --name frozenlake --display-name "frozenlake"
~~~~

4. Open the notebook.

~~~~
jupyter notebook Frozen_Lake.ipynb
~~~~

5. Before running code, change the kernel to match the quadcop environment by using the drop-down menu (Kernel > Change kernel > quadcop). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

6. You will likely need to install more pip packages to complete this project. Please curate the list of packages needed to run your project in the requirements.txt file in the repository.
